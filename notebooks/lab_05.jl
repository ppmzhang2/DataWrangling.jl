# Lab 5. Stringing Julia together with Dates and all the rest

Most of the operations that R can do on strings, and more, are available for Julia.

As the R lab is long, here I only suggest you some readings and activities in Julia.

**Strings** operations are in the base Julia system.
You can read more [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/index.html).

**Mapping** and **iterations** also are in the base system.
You can read more [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/).

Moreover, as Julia gets compiled, loops (for, while, ...) are extremely performing.
Where in `R` it is not suggested to write in Loops, in Julia is perfectly fine :-)
